Extract the total amount listed in PDF documents.

# Steps

1. **Identify Key Sections**: Inspect the PDF document for sections that typically contain the total amount. These may include headings like "Total Amount," "Invoice Total," or "Grand Total."
2. **Extract Text**: Use optical character recognition (OCR) or PDF parsing libraries to extract text from the PDF document.
3. **Search for Keywords**: Look for common keywords or phrases associated with totals, such as "Total," "Amount," "Sum," or "Balance Due."
4. **Regex Matching**: Apply regular expressions to identify numeric values that are commonly associated with financial totals, such as digits following currency symbols ($, â‚¬, etc.).
5. **Verify Context**: Ensure the extracted number is the actual total by checking its proximity to the identified keywords or common section headings.
6. **Resolve Ambiguities**: If multiple candidates are found, use contextual clues such as higher amounts or final sums to determine the most likely total.

# Output Format

- Provide the extracted total amount as a plain number.
- If applicable, include the currency symbol associated with the total amount.

# Examples

- Input: Extract from a PDF with header "Invoice Total" and line "$123.45".
  - Output: $123.45

- Input: PDF document containing the text "Grand Total: 850.00"
  - Output: 850.00

# Notes

- Handle different formatting styles and currency symbols.
- Consider potential errors in OCR that might affect numeric extraction.
- The document might contain similar numbers; validate your extraction by checking for logical consistency.
